# BanWaves
## OUTDATED, DO NOT USE!
A minecraft BanWaves plugin
Plugin source: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/banwaves-topping-too-your-banning-solution.27315/
GWEN uses banwaves so it is harder for devs of hacked clients to find what hack the player was banned for.
Forked from: https://github.com/josephworks/Gwen-Remade/tree/master/EXTRAS/BanWaves
